I extend my appreciation to Lucia Park for the remarkable design inspiration. While the core essence of the design remains intact, some adaptations and implementations have been made to match the project's requirements.

It's important to note that while the primary design is credited to Lucia Park, this implementation involved adjustments to fit the specific needs of this project. This includes modifications related to the use of different assets, variations in layout, color schemes, and additional functional elements.

The aim was to leverage Lucia Park's original design as a foundation while tailoring it to suit the objectives and context of this project. The link provided above directs to the original design for reference.
